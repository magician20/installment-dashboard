# Test Flexible Plan Flow

## Current Implementation Analysis

### 1. Order Creation with Flexible Plan
- User selects a flexible installment plan
- Order total: 20,000 EGP
- Advance payment: 5,000 EGP
- Plan duration: 6 months
- Interest rate: 8%

### 2. Payment Processing
- User processes advance payment of 5,000 EGP
- Payment is recorded in `payments` table with `order_id`
- No `installment_id` (correct for advance payment)

### 3. Installment Generation
The `create_installments_for_order` function calculates:
- Remaining amount: 20,000 - 5,000 = 15,000 EGP
- Monthly payment: (15,000 × 1.08) ÷ 6 = 2,700 EGP
- Creates 6 installments of 2,700 EGP each

### 4. Expected Results
- **Payments table**: 1 record (advance payment)
- **Installments table**: 6 records (monthly installments)
- **Total paid**: 5,000 EGP (advance)
- **Remaining**: 16,200 EGP (6 × 2,700 EGP)

## Verification Steps

1. Create order with flexible plan
2. Process advance payment
3. Check payments table for advance payment record
4. Check installments table for 6 monthly installments
5. Verify amounts are correct

## Current Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED CORRECTLY

The flexible plan flow is working as specified:
- Advance payment is recorded in payments table
- Monthly installments are generated from remaining amount
- Interest is applied to remaining amount only
- All transactions are properly linked to the order
